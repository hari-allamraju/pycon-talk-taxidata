# pycon-talk-taxidata

Repo for my talk on machine learning with taxi data at PyCon APAC 2017 and PyCon JP 2017.

The analysis is in the IPython notebooks under the notebooks folder. The slides in both Apple Keynote and PDF format are in the slides format.

The requirements, and the underlying code for this is given in the requirements.txt file. You will need to install these and run the notebooks once in order to see all the results.
